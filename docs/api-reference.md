# API Reference

## Workspace management

Every workspace belongs to exactly one user (`owner_id`, a Keycloak `sub`) — a user only ever sees and modifies their own workspaces.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/workspaces` | List the current user's workspaces |
| `POST` | `/workspaces` | Create workspace — body: `{ name, path?, description? }` (`path` = XML file to import) |
| `PUT` | `/workspaces/:id` | Rename workspace and/or update `description` |
| `DELETE` | `/workspaces/:id` | Delete workspace (deleting the active one switches to another owned by the user; deleting the last one is allowed and leaves zero — the web UI then redirects to its `/workspaces` page to create a new one) |
| `POST` | `/workspaces/:id/activate` | Switch the current user's active workspace |

## Model routes

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Active workspace info + model metadata |
| `POST` | `/save` | No-op (writes are persisted immediately); kept for compatibility |
| `GET` | `/export` | Download model as Open Exchange XML |
| `POST` | `/import` | Replace the active workspace model from an XML body |

## Elements

| `GET` | `/elements` | List elements (`?type=`, `?name=`) |
| `GET` | `/elements/:id` | Get element |
| `POST` | `/elements` | Create element — `{ name, type, documentation?, properties? }` |
| `PUT` | `/elements/:id` | Update element (partial) |
| `DELETE` | `/elements/:id` | Delete element (cascades to relationships and view nodes) |

## Relationships

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/relationships/types` | Sorted list of relationship types present |
| `GET` | `/relationships` | List (`?type=`, `?source_id=`, `?target_id=`) |
| `GET` | `/relationships/:id` | Get relationship |
| `POST` | `/relationships` | Create — `{ type, source, target, name?, documentation?, is_directed?, access_type?, influence_strength? }` |

| `GET` | `/views/:id/image` | Render view as SVG (`?format=svg`; PNG export is client-side) |

## Property definitions

| Method | Path | Description |
