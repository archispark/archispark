## Views (`/views`)

![Views list with status, viewpoint, nodes, and connections](/screenshots/views.png)

### Diagram list

The table displays a **status** icon (✓ if all connections are valid, a warning
if at least one conflicts, or — if the view has no connections), **Name**
(clickable link), **Viewpoint**, **Nodes**, and **Connections**.

The filters at the top let you limit the list to **All / OK / Conflicts**.
Expand a row to see the breakdown of valid and conflicting relationships for
that view.

Click a view name to open its **detail page** with the interactive canvas.

### Create a view

Click **+ New view**:

1. **Name** — required
2. **Viewpoint** — select from 28 ArchiMate viewpoints (loaded from the API)
3. **Documentation** — optional

### Edit / delete

Use the buttons on each row.

## View detail (`/views/:id`)

### Interactive canvas

The canvas uses React Flow to display and edit the diagram.

**Available interactions:**

| Action              | Gesture                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Pan the view        | Click and drag the background                  |
| Zoom                | Mouse wheel                                    |
| Select a node       | Click it                                       |
| Move a node         | Click and drag                                 |
| Resize a node       | Corner handles                                 |
| Add a node          | Drag an element from the side panel            |
| Create a connection | Click and drag from one node handle to another |
| Delete a node       | Select → Delete key                            |
| Delete a connection | Select → Delete key                            |
| Fit the view        | Control buttons (bottom left)                  |

**Nodes and styles:**

- Nodes are colored by ArchiMate layer
- Shapes follow ArchiMate notation (hexagon = Function, chevron = Event,
  pill = Service, and so on)
- Connections use orthogonal routing with standard relationship markers
  (diamond = Composition, open arrowhead = Realization, and so on)

**Export the canvas:** The **Download PNG** button (bottom right) exports the
canvas as displayed using `html-to-image`.

> Editing the canvas (moving/resizing nodes, adding elements, and creating or
> deleting connections), as well as renaming the view, editing its
> documentation/viewpoint, and deleting it, requires write access.

### Validator display

Below the canvas, a **Validator** panel lists every relationship rendered as a
connection in the view, with its ArchiMate compliance status (✓ / conflict),
source, and target. This is the same table as on the Relationships page,
filtered to the connections in this view — use it to check a diagram before
sharing it.

> The former `/validator` route still exists for backward compatibility and
> redirects to `/views` — the validator itself now lives on each view's detail
> page, as described above.
